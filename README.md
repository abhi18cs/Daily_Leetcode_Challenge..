About LeetCode
LeetCode is a platform that hosts a collection of coding challenges that help developers prepare for technical interviews. The platform contains over 1,000 problems covering various topics such as algorithms, data structures, database, and system design. The problems range from easy to hard, and they are created by seasoned developers from leading tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft.



Folder Structure
Each problem solution is contained in a separate folder. The folder name is the same as the problem's ID on the LeetCode platform. Inside each folder, you will find the following files:



README.md: This file contains the problem statement and a brief explanation of the approach I used to solve the problem.


question_name.java: This file contains the JAVA code that solves the problem.


Contributing
